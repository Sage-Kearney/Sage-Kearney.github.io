                    <p>If you've been longing to know what kind of cat you would be if you so happen you reincarnate into one, boy oh boy do I have a treat for you! This was my first project during my immersive program with General Assembly. Tasked to apply our recently aquired coding knoweledge, I used Javascript, HTML, & CSS to create a fun, lighthearted quiz that all of my girlfriends would enjoy taking on thier lunch break. </p>

                  <p>I developed this custom website for my final project during a 10 week front end web development course with General Assembly. Bear Hug Honey Co is a friend of a friend's  small business & I was inspired by a recent trip to thier store to redesign their existing website. Built with Jquery, HTML, & CSS, this website highlights Bear Hug's commitment to conservation in their community driven, locally inspired business. </p>

      <p>
        Yep. You read it right. I want to change your world. Might seem like a
        tall order but, what can I say, I like to dream big. Want to dream big
        with me?

            <h2>Hey there!</h2>
            <p>
              I'm Sage- welcome to my little corner of the web! Here are three
              things you need to know about me.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                I am super passionate about leveraging my design skills & tech
                knoweledge for the benifit of small bizz owners. I love
                collaborating with other creatives, figuring out how to problem
                solve solutions so they can be efficient with their time &
                resources, give their clients the best user experince, and reach
                thier goals while living the life they've always dreams of.
              </li>
              <li>
                I am a developer by trade, but an artist at heart. I grew up as that
                weird art kid. You know what I'm talking about- there's always that
                one kid. I studied 3D art in college & fell deeply in love with the
                world of clay. Hit a few bumps in the road & ended up developing a
                giant passion for graphic design, photography, & visual
                communiction. Fast forward a few years & I discover the world of
                codeing & html & css..the rest is history. Never thought I would be
                remotely interested in anything tech, but life is funny like that-
                right?
              </li>
              <li>
                I have a miniture dashaund that has me wrapped around his finger..if
                you couldn't tell already.
              </li>
            </ul>

              Dont ask yourself what the world need. Ask yourself what makes you
              come alive, and go do that, because what the world needs is people who
              have come alive
