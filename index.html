                    <h2>Hey there!</h2>
                    <p>I'm Sage- welcome to my little corner of the web! Here are three things you need to know about me.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I am super passionate about leveraging my design skills & tech knoweledge for the benifit of small bizz owners. I love collaborating with other creatives, figuring out how to problem solve solutions so they can be efficient with their time & resources, give their clients the best user experince, and reach thier damn goals while living the life they've always dreams of </li>
                        <li>I am a developer by trade, but an artist at heart. I grew up as that weird art kid. You know what I'm talking about- there's always that one kid. I studied 3D art in college & fell deeply in love with the world of clay. Hit a few bumps in the road & ended up developing a giant passion for graphic design, photography, & visual communiction. Fast forward a few years & I discover the world of codeing & html & css..the rest is history. Never thought I would be remotely interested in anything tech, but life is funny like that- right?</li>
                        <li>I have a miniture dashaund that has me wrapped around his finger..if you couldn't tell already.</li>
